# AGENTS.md - Law Firm Management System

- Never commit, push, or create PRs unless explicitly asked.
- Read the actual file first. Don't assume you know what's in it.
- After making changes, run `pnpm validate` + `pnpm build` and loop (fix issues, re-run until passing).
- Stop validating/linting/building on trivial changes like DOCS, trivial CSS (e.g. spacing, colors on existing rules), TEXT, maybe format. Do NOT skip validation for substantive CSS changes (new components, layout changes, structural modifications).

## Tech Stack

- Framework: Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19 + React Compiler.
- Language: TypeScript strict, `@/*` alias for `./src/*`.
- Styling: CSS Modules + design tokens (`src/styles/variables.css` primitives → semantic tokens). `clsx` for composition. Never inline styles.
- UI: `react-aria-components` — wrap Aria primitives in local components (e.g. `Button.tsx` wraps `Button as AriaButton`); extend Aria props, apply CSS modules via `clsx`, forward external `className`.
- Icons: `react-icons` (subpath imports like `react-icons/fa6`).
- Auth: NextAuth v5 beta (`next-auth@5.0.0-beta.31`) with Google OAuth, JWT sessions, PrismaAdapter.
- Data: Prisma 7 + PostgreSQL via `@prisma/adapter-pg`. Adapter pattern: `new PrismaClient({ adapter: new PrismaPg({ connectionString }) })`. Generated client at `src/generated/prisma/`. Singleton at `src/lib/prisma.ts`. Prisma config at `prisma.config.ts`.
- Storage: `@aws-sdk/client-s3` api compatible for managing document storage attachments via secure, server-generated presigned URLs.
- Package Manager: pnpm.

## Architecture

- `src/app/(auth)/page.tsx` — unauthenticated login page.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/` — authenticated section (Sidebar + Header shared layout). Dashboard routes: `dashboard/`, `case/`, `consultation/`, `user/`.
- API Routes — Restricted strictly to framework orchestration (`src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`) and scheduled job webhooks (e.g. `src/app/api/cron/*/route.ts`). Do not create custom REST endpoints for application data under any circumstances.
- Server Actions (`actions.ts`) — The primary mechanism for all data mutation, form submission, and infrastructure execution (including generating storage presigned URLs). Every structural modification to application state must route through a Server Action.
- `src/features/` — domain logic organized by feature (`auth/`, `users/`, `consultations/`, `cases/`, etc.).
  - Each domain contains `actions.ts` (orchestration, validation, and authorization), `queries.ts` (Prisma read operations), and `mutations.ts` (Prisma write operations).
  - Feature-specific components live in `src/features/{domain}/components/`.
- `src/components/{ui,layout}/` — shared primitives (ui) and app chrome (layout). Domain-agnostic; reusable across features.
- `src/lib/` — shared utilities: `prisma.ts` (singleton), `auth.ts` (NextAuth config), `s3.ts` (S3 client instance initialization), etc.
- `src/styles/` — design tokens (`variables.css`: primitives → semantic tokens).
- `src/stories/` — Storybook stories for UI components, imported via `@/` aliases.
- Docker Compose for local Postgres: `docker compose up -d`.

## Conventions

### Styling

- Token system: primitives (`--raw-*`) → semantic tokens (`--color-*`, `--space-*`, etc.).
- Style exclusively via CSS Modules, imported as `styles` and composed with `clsx`.
- Never use inline styles (except storybooks) or global element selectors.
- Nesting in CSS Modules must mirror the component or document hierarchy (parent element nests children).
- Accept and forward external `className` props for overrides.
- Prefer semantic tokens from `variables.css`. Hardcoded values are fine for one-off cases (single-use spacing, border-radius, etc.) — creating a variable for a value used only once is overengineering. Extract to `variables.css` when the same value appears twice or more.

- Responsives:
- Desktop first aproach CSS - mobile will be added later.
- Use flexbox whenever possible - avoid grid.
- `@media` only at `48rem` (use literal `rem` — CSS variables don't work in media queries).
- Avoid the use JS viewport detection or conditional mobile/desktop components for layout — use CSS where possible.

### Components

- Always scan and use existing components from `components/` first.
- Scan `src/lib/` for existing utilities before creating new types/functions to avoid duplication.
- Interactive/browser API components: start with `"use client"`.
- Co-locate in `src/components/{category}/{ComponentName}/` — component, CSS module.
- Stories live in `src/stories/`, imported via `@/` aliases (no relative `./` imports).
- Wrapping Aria components pattern: extend Aria props interface, add local variants/props, use explicit interface.
- Extract component props into a named interface extending the Aria type when adding local variants/props — keeps function signatures terse and consistent.

### Data Layer & Asset Storage

- Each feature domain (`src/features/{domain}/`) owns its data logic split across three files:
  - `actions.ts` — Next.js Server Actions (`"use server"`). This layer acts as the security and evaluation perimeter. It enforces authentication, evaluates role authorization, validates inputs via Zod schemas, and orchestrates calls to underlying mutations or queries.
  - `queries.ts` — Prisma read operations (`findUnique`, `findMany`, aggregate, etc.). Plain async functions (no `"use server"`).
  - `mutations.ts` — Prisma write operations (`create`, `update`, `upsert`, `delete`, etc.). Plain async functions.
- Execution Protocol: Components must never invoke `queries.ts` or `mutations.ts` directly if the action requires data filtering or mutation safety. Components call Server Actions to enforce authorization and schema validation boundaries. Server Components may call optimized, plain query functions from `queries.ts` exclusively for read operations where user session parameters are handled explicitly.
- Binary Document Management: File uploads must never stream through or be parsed by the Next.js runtime environment. When a client needs to save an item (e.g., a case file artifact):
  1. The client invokes a secure Server Action requesting a upload target.
  2. The Server Action validates permissions and generates an S3 presigned URL via `@aws-sdk/client-s3`.
  3. The client receives the URL and executes a native client-side `fetch` browser payload directly to the storage bucket.
- Cascade document cleanup: Deleting a Case, Consultation, or Task must also purge its attached S3 document blobs, not just the cascaded `Document` rows. The database is the source of truth, so each delete mutation deletes the `Document` rows (via `onDelete: Cascade`) **before** calling `deleteDocumentFiles` (in `src/lib/storage-cleanup.ts`). `deleteDocumentFiles` is best-effort and idempotent: it deletes each S3 object and logs but does not propagate individual failures, because the records are already gone. This guarantees no dangling `Document` rows pointing at missing files. Any S3 objects left behind by a cleanup failure are harmless orphans reclaimed by the storage GC sweep (`src/app/api/cron/storage-gc`). Never reverse the order — deleting storage first would leave `Document` rows referencing missing blobs.
- Never import `prisma` directly outside of `queries.ts` or `mutations.ts`.
- Prisma client vs browser entry: Any module reachable by client components (UI components, and Zod schemas referenced at runtime in the browser) MUST import enums/models from `@/generated/prisma/browser`, never `@/generated/prisma/client`. The `client` entry imports `node:` builtins and breaks `next build` (Turbopack `node:module` error) if pulled into the client bundle.
- Co-locate feature-specific components in `src/features/{domain}/components/`. Only put truly shared/reusable components in `src/components/ui/`.
- Client-side role checks: Use `can(userRole, permission, access?)` from `@/lib/rbac` for UI presentation (show/hide tabs, buttons, columns). This is a pure boolean check — never use it for enforcement. All security boundaries must remain server-side in Server Actions via `requirePermission(...)` (context-free cells) or `requireAuth()` + `can(...)` (record-scoped cells).
- RBAC actions: Do **not** hide per-record action buttons (Edit, Delete, View, etc.) with client-side RBAC checks. Always render the action and let the Server Action return an `ActionStatusResponse`; surface the result via the shared helpers in `src/lib/toast-utils.ts` (e.g. `toastActionError`). The server owns access-context decisions, and users should see why an action failed rather than having buttons silently disappear. Reserve client-side `can()` gating for coarse, context-free UI (e.g. tabs or Add buttons), not row actions. If hiding an action is clearly better UX in a specific case, flag it.
- Read permission gating: For button/row actions (View/Open), follow the same rule: always render them and surface denials via the toast helpers (`toastDenied()`). For navigation links to inaccessible pages, also render the link; the destination should show an empty body with an “Access denied” message using the `DashboardError` / access-denied pattern.
- Scan `src/lib/` for existing utilities before creating new types/functions to avoid duplication.

### Testing

- Test files live in `__tests__/` directories co-located with their feature/component (Next.js convention).
  Example: `src/features/users/__tests__/queries.test.ts`
- Naming: `*.test.ts` for logic, `*.test.tsx` for components.
- Mock `@/lib/prisma` via `vi.mock` for data-layer tests. Use Prisma types for mock values (no `as any`).

### Security & Boundary Safety

- Input Validation with Zod: Every exported Server Action must validate its input via `z.safeParse()` before executing any business logic. Do not declare schemas inside action files; import them from feature-specific schema files (e.g., `@/features/cases/schemas`) so they can be reused by client forms.
- String Hygiene & Parsing: Ensure all string parameters in schemas call `.trim().min(1)` and include a `.max()` constraint matching database limits to prevent malicious database exhaustion. Reject whitespace-only values.
  - Strict Parameter Assurances: Validate all structural parameters meticulously. Ensure IDs call `.uuid()` or `.cuid()`, and enforce strictly defined sets using `z.enum(PrismaEnum)` where `PrismaEnum` is the generated const-object enum (e.g. `TaskStatus` from `@/generated/prisma/browser`). Never accept raw string inputs to cast them inside the function body via `as`.
- Action Response Convention:
  - Read actions (paginated queries, single-record fetches): Return data directly
    (e.g., `Promise<{ rows: T[]; nextCursor: string | null }>`). Let framework error
    boundaries handle failures — throw for unrecoverable errors. No wrapper needed.
  - Write actions (create, update, delete): Wrap execution in try-catch and return
    `Promise<ActionStatusResponse>`. Use `ActionDataResponse<T>` when returning
    created/updated data alongside the status. This lets the client display inline
    error messages (toasts) without navigating away.
- Never allow raw server exceptions to leak to the client. For writes, catch and
  return structured errors; for reads, the framework error boundary is sufficient.
- Centralized Auth Guards: Invoke unified, centralized protection functions at the very top of the execution flow: `requireAuth()` (verified session) or `requirePermission(...permissions)` (context-free RBAC cells). Both throw typed errors (`UnauthorizedError`, `ForbiddenError`) — there is no non-throwing variant. For write actions that return `ActionStatusResponse`, call the throwing guards inside the action's existing `try` block and let `toActionResponse(...)` map `UnauthorizedError` → the unauthorized envelope ("Session expired") and `ForbiddenError` → the forbidden envelope ("Access denied"). Record-scoped cells are checked per record via `assertRecordPermission(session, permission, accessContext)` (throws `"Forbidden"`) or `can(role, permission, accessContext)` (boolean) after loading the context. Do not write inline, ad-hoc `auth()` verification logic inside individual actions.
- Typed Payloads over Raw FormData: Client components must pass clean, typed objects to actions instead of raw `FormData`. Any necessary coercion or extraction from forms must occur on the client side before triggering the transition boundary. Shared normalization/validation helpers live in `src/lib/form-utils.ts` (`optionalString`, `requiredString`, `toDateValue`, `selectEnumHandler`, `keysToSet`, `createFieldValidator`) and the `useModalForm` hook — reuse these instead of ad-hoc trimming or `as` casts.
- Modal form validation: Use React Aria's default `validationBehavior="native"`. Wrap a modal's fields + actions in a RAC `<Form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>` and make the submit button `type="submit"` (Cancel must be `type="button"`). On submit RAC runs each field's `validate`, blocks `onSubmit`, and shows inline errors only when invalid — errors never appear on open. **Never use `validationBehavior="aria"`**: it renders a required field's error on mount (before any interaction), which is the premature-error regression. Keep the submit button enabled so RAC surfaces inline errors on submit; rely on `useModalForm`'s `schema` guard + toast for the server-side failure path. Define user-facing validation messages in the Zod schemas via the shared builders in `form-utils` (`requiredText`, `optionalText`, `positiveNumber`, `requiredEnum`, `emailText`) — never surface raw Zod messages like "Invalid input: expected string, received undefined".

### Error Handling & Logging

- Structured envelope: write actions never return raw string errors. Failures
  use `ActionStatusResponse.error = { code, title, description }` from
  `src/lib/action-response.ts`. `description` is mandatory — every user-facing
  failure explains what happened and what to do next.
- Factory presets only: build failures with `actionForbidden()`,
  `actionNotFound(entity)`, `actionInvalid(entity)`, `actionConflict(title, description)`,
  `actionLocked()`, `actionUnauthorized()` from `src/lib/action-response.ts`.
  Hand-rolled `{ success: false, error: ... }` literals in actions are banned.
- Single catch path: route caught exceptions through
  `toActionResponse(error, operation, conflict?)` from `src/lib/errors.ts`. It
  classifies known errors (`ForbiddenError`, `UnauthorizedError`,
  `TaskLockedError`, Prisma `P2002`) into presets, logs unclassified causes via
  `src/lib/logger.ts` (`logError(context, error)`), and returns a sanitized
  unknown envelope. Bare `catch {}` that discards the error is banned.
- Log/client split: full error details stay in server logs; the client only
  ever receives the sanitized envelope copy. Never send stack traces or Prisma
  internals through responses.
- Toast helpers: client components enqueue toasts exclusively via
  `src/lib/toast-utils.ts` (`toastSuccess`, `toastInfo`, `toastError`,
  `toastActionError(response, operation)`, `toastDenied`, `toastNotFound`).
  Ad-hoc `queue.add(...)` calls in feature code are banned. Every toast carries
  both a title and a description; timeouts are standardized by the helpers.
- Copy style: titles are short sentence-case labels without a trailing period
  ("Failed to update case"); descriptions are complete sentences ending with a
  period ("The case may have been deleted by another user.").
- Reads remain throwing: read actions throw (`ForbiddenError` digests drive the
  access-denied boundary); only write actions return envelopes.

### Async & Error Handling

- Default to `async/await` with `try...catch` for asynchronous code. Preserve or use `.then()/.catch()` only when it is the idiomatic, clearer, or required approach for the specific code pattern.
- Never let a promise rejection go unhandled. In client components, surface failures through the shared toast helpers in `src/lib/toast-utils.ts` (`toastError`, `toastActionError`, etc.) or appropriate error UI. In Server Actions, follow the existing Action Response Convention (catch and return a structured `ActionStatusResponse`).
- Inside `useEffect`, wrap async work in a locally-scoped `async function` and invoke it (use `void` for fire-and-forget calls to keep intent explicit).

### General

- Idiomatic, modular code is the top priority in this project, not a collection of hacks and workarounds.
- Named exports only — no default exports, except for Next.js special files (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `error.tsx`, `global-error.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `route.tsx` etc.) which require a default export. Use inline `export default function` for these files.
- PascalCase components/types; camelCase variables/functions/files (component dirs are PascalCase).
- No inline `//` comments unless explaining a non-obvious decision. TSDoc on `src/lib/` helpers is the explicit exception (see Documentation).
- Prisma schema: `snake_case` fields, `PascalCase` models/enums.
- Husky: pre-commit runs `lint-staged` (Prettier + ESLint on staged files); pre-push runs `pnpm validate && pnpm test`.

### Documentation (TSDoc)

- TSDoc (`/** … */`) is required on **all** functions and exported types/interfaces in `src/lib/`, plus a module-level doc on the infra/config files (`auth.ts`, `prisma.ts`, `s3.ts`).
- Use `@param`, `@returns`, and `@typeParam` where applicable; keep descriptions terse and within the 100-char print width (Prettier reformats).
- This convention is **scoped to `src/lib/` only**. Do not add TSDoc to feature or component code — it adds noise. Inline `//` comments remain banned (see General).

## TypeScript Coding Standards

### Parameter Typing and Readability

- Ban Destructured Inline Types: Never mix inline type declarations and object destructuring within function parameter signatures (e.g., `({ a, b }: { a: string; b: string })`).
- Parameter Handling for Standard Functions: For standard utility functions and business logic, pass complex inputs as a single unified object argument (e.g., `payload: DocumentPayload`) and destructure it within the first lines of the function body.
- Component Props Exception: Standard React Functional Components are exempt from the parameters-as-payload formatting rule. Component signatures may use inline destructuring of explicitly typed prop interfaces (e.g., `export function Button({ variant, children, ...props }: ButtonProps)`) to facilitate direct application of rest parameter extraction and prop forwarding.
- Inline Type Scope: Simple inline object types are permitted only if the object consists of 3 or fewer primitive properties, is not destructured in the signature, and is scoped entirely within a non-exported utility helper.

### Domain-Driven Naming (Anti-Nominal)

- No Function-Scoped Type Names: Do not name interfaces or types after a single specific function (avoid `ProcessDataArgs`).
- Focus on the Data Shape: Name types after the domain data or payload they represent (e.g., `DocumentPayload`, `UserSession`). This ensures types are structurally reusable across database utilities, API boundaries, and UI components.

### Boundary Type Strictness

- Explicit Returns at Boundaries: Always explicitly declare return types on public API endpoints, exported Server Actions, and shared hooks (e.g., `Promise<ActionStatusResponse>` for write actions). This protects contracts and speeds up compilation times.
- Implicit Internal Returns: Allow TypeScript's native type inference engine to handle return types for internal, unexported helper functions or simple utility chains.

### Code Patterns

Avoid this signature clutter:

```typescript
// ANTI-PATTERN: Heavy cognitive load, zero reusability
export async function updateRecordAction({ id, status, retry }: { id: string; status: "pending" | "done"; retry: boolean }) { ... }
```

Enforce this clean, reusable structure:

```typescript
// IDIOMATIC: Clear boundaries, reusable domain types, flexible composition
export interface TaskPayload {
  id: string;
  status: "pending" | "done";
  retry: boolean;
}

export async function updateRecordAction(payload: TaskPayload): Promise<ActionStatusResponse> {
  const { id, status, retry } = payload;
  // implementation
  return { success: true };
}
```

#### Avoid overengineering:

Do not introduce a new named interface or type alias for trivial object shapes (e.g. `{ id: string }`) or for simple projections that can be expressed with `Pick<PrismaModel, Keys>`. Prefer using `Pick<PrismaModel, Keys>` directly for one-off or local projections. If the projection becomes a meaningful domain concept that is reused across multiple APIs, layers, or modules, give it a semantic name by aliasing the `Pick` (e.g. `type UserSummary = Pick<User, "id" | "name">`) rather than duplicating the property definitions. Only define a custom object type when the output intentionally diverges from the source model—for example, by combining data from multiple sources, adding computed fields, or reshaping the data.
